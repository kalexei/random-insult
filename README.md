# RANDOM INSULT SCRIPT

This is a bash script I wrote after I found the [Fuck Off As A Service](https://foaas.com/) API.

I found it kinda funny and thought it'd be even funnier if every time I opened my terminal it would write one of those phrases.

You can use the output text from this script in cowsay like I did:

```sh
~/script.sh | cowsay -f tux
```

Feel free to use this any way you want, just try not to use the API in a malicious manner by hacking into someone's machine and sending them these texts without their permission :)
